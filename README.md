# Load-Calculator
A load calculator for aerialists to determine characteristic loads for their rigging equipment ratings


## Needs:
- Form
  - Input weight of apparatus & rigging equipment (lbs)  
  - Input weight of performer(s) (lbs)  
  - Dropdown select apparatus for dynamic load max factor  
  - Input to show output of estimated characteristic load
  - Conversion of lbf to kN

- Stretch goals
  - Different mass/weight system choices lbs/kgs
  - Enter dynamic load in lbs/kg

convert lbf to kn for rigging equipment requirements  
add dynamic forces for different apparatus  

Input fields:
Weight of apparatus & (lbs)  
Weight of performer (lbs)  
Choose apparatus (* dynamic factor)  

Output fields:
Estimated Characteristic Load
Conversion to Kilonewton

Weight of performers & rigging equipment × dynamic load factor × safety factor of 6 (from ANSI 1.43 2016 Entertainment Technology — Performer Flying Systems Subsection 4.6.5).

Example:  
(440lbs performers + 10lbs trapeze) × 3 dynamic load max factor × 6 ANSI safety factor = 8100lbs. max safety trapeze performers
